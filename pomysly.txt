I don't make mistakes, I'm not like the rest of you, I'm stronger, I'm smarter, I'm better, I AM BETTER. I'm not some weak kneed fucking crybaby that goes around fucking apolgizing all the time and why the fuck would you want me to be? All my life people have tried to control me, rich people, powerful people, tried to muzzle me, cancel me, keep me impotent and obedient like I'm a fucking puppet. And you know what it worked, Because I allowed it to work and guess what, If they can control me they can control you, they already do you just realize it. I am done, I am done apolgizing, I am done being persecuted for my strength, You should be thanking christ that I am who I am, because you need me, you need me to save you, You Do, I am the only one who possibly can. You're not the real heroes, I am the real hero, I am the real hero
